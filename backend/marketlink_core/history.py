"""Audit trail helpers (simple_history) — v1.8.

Tracked models: FarmerProfile, Product, Order, OrderItem, FarmerMarket, PickupSlot, FarmerClosure.
Every write to them must go through save() / delete() (never QuerySet.update() or plain
bulk_create, which skip the history row). These helpers stamp the history row with a reason
("Order #12 accepted (T2)") and, for system actions, an explicit user (None = system).
